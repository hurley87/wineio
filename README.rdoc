- pulled wine data from the LCBO and Snooth API using AJAX. 
- Angular to display an Instagram feed on the homepage. 
- Mapbox API to load every wine location on a map. When users click a point on the map they are brought to the wine's show page to learn more.
- user can sign up and add wine to their wine rack

This is still a work in progress. I'm figuring out a way to filter the Instagram feed by location. I'm also thinking about a feature where users can sign in through their instagram and post a picture with a wine hashtag. Users with the most likes are ranked higher.
